Dear Tutors,
although all our efforts and invested time we were not able to successfully complete the assignment when executing our code we received 
a ValueError in line
     78   f"No gradients provided for any variable: {variable}. "
and  79   f"Provided `grads_and_vars` is {grads_and_vars}. 
Even after intensive investigating we could not resolve this error and get the code running correctly, however we have the complete model, so we hope that is in order.
